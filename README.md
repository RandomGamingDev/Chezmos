# Chezmos
Basically a version of Desmos that uses javascript for graph plotting allowing for the easy use of external libraries and more complex mathematical functions and concepts like recursion.

To start open up the application on your web browser. There you can use the + and - features to create new functions with each function being on a different row. With a column for the name, one for the color, and one for the javascript code containing the equation itself. To run simply press the run button, with any errors being printed out to the console right below the graph. If you want to resize the graph simply resize domain by declaring the low, high, and step of a range. The limit for the number of x values that can be in this domain is 10000. If you want to add libraries, for example math or display libraries you can simply use the add library button to add whatever libraries you want. Although, beware, due to how javascript works you can't just remove these libraries so any that you add are added to the instance until you refresh.
